> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?
I am continuing with my quest to read nearly everything in the Tom Clancy Jack Ryan universe. This is the latest. And I am tired. I am not up for something more lofty. Just give me this.

### Publisher Summary

A Russian plot to seize the Panama Canal plunges President Jack Ryan into a desperate fight for his life in the latest entry in the #1 New York Times bestselling series.

For a century, the Panama Canal has served as the path between the seas. Control of this vital waterway is the difference between free trade and chaos in world markets.

So when Panamanian President Rafael Botero asks for a show of support against the socialist opposition, his old friend President Jack Ryan canâ€™t turn down an invitation to visit the country, but what seems like an ordinary opportunity to preach the values of democracy quickly turns into a nightmare when a full-blown coup dâ€™Ã©tat erupts.

President Ryan and his Secret Service team are cut off and out of communication. In Washington, the Vice President is coordinating a military response, but there's still one more obstacle.

One of the main forces behind the coup is the ruthless criminal organization known as the Camarilla. Theyâ€™ve had their tentacles deep inside the plot to overthrow the government. All of their hard work has just presented them with an unexpected opportunity they canâ€™t resistâ€”the chance to kill President Jack Ryan.

## Notes - No Spoilers
* Always happy to have an Adam Yao sighting even when it makes no sense. Like this. The CIA agent who speaks Chines, who operated without a cover in Hong Kong, who helped track down submarine technology in China - is now leading hit squads in Latin America? Okay sure.
* Watch alert: John Clark wearing a Seiko Turtle, Yao wearing a Timex Ironman (on a mission, he owns a Sub), Jack Ryan wears a Rolex Explorer II, Chilly wears a Tudor Ranger which I am skeptical about.
* Founding Farmers in DC gets a shout out.
* This book was pretty goofy. I realize this series jumped the shark a long time ago, but it's obvious Marc Cameron was finishing this final entry of his into the series on a deadline before cashinbg the check and getting on to his own series.
