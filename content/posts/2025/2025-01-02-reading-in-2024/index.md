I [keep a log](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading/) of the books I read or listen to as part of this blog. I previously did a manual audit of my annual reading list, but this year I am going to let OpenAI handle it for me. This is kind of a perfect use case for AI. I have a large block of semi-structured data. I want some analysis. And I think that analysis is better done externally since I am biased.

## 4. Observations & Highlights

1. **Tom Clancy Universe**  
   - 6 novels (40% of your total reading).  
   - Often your ‚Äúrelaxation‚Äù choice after denser non-fiction.

2. **History & Non-Fiction**  
   - You read more historical topics in 2024 than in 2023, especially on Iberia, Islamic Spain, and global maritime history.  
   - The ‚Äúcopyright and AI‚Äù angle (e.g., *Who Owns This Sentence?*) was a new area.

3. **Sci-Fi Run**  
   - Mid-to-late 2024 saw multiple sci-fi titles (Corey, Scalzi).  
   - This replaced last year‚Äôs RomCom picks from Emily Henry.

4. **Reading Pace**  
   - Some books took months (*Lawrence in Arabia*), while memoir or lighter reads (e.g., *Troubled*) finished in a single day.  
   - Audiobooks typically accompanied workouts/travel over many weeks.

5. **Locations**  
   - Heavy reading in Lisbon/Sintra again, plus short stints during flights/trips.  
   - You listened to Crowley titles while running or at the gym‚Äîsimilar pattern to last year‚Äôs approach with audiobooks.

---

## 5. Final Thoughts

- You ended up with **15 total** works in both 2023 and 2024, but with a **shift** from paperbacks/hardcovers toward purely Kindle in 2024.  
- Non-fiction took up a **bigger slice** this year (7 of 15) compared to 2023‚Äôs 4 of 15.  
- You continued your Clancy run and expanded your sci-fi horizons‚Äîreplacing 2023‚Äôs RomCom picks with extra space operas and futuristic military tales.  
- Location patterns (Lisbon, Sintra) and audiobook usage (during workouts/travel) remained consistent.  

In short, 2024 featured more digital reading, more history/sci-fi, and fewer physical books or RomComs than 2023‚Äîyet you maintained the same total number of titles consumed overall. It‚Äôs a good snapshot of evolving tastes within your reliably prolific reading routine.
