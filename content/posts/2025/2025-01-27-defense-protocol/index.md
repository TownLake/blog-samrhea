> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?
I am continuing with my quest to read nearly everything in the Tom Clancy Jack Ryan universe. This is the latest. And I am tired. I am not up for something more lofty. Just give me this.

### Publisher Summary

The stakes are sky-high when a power-mad Chinese president threatens Taiwan in the #1 New York Times bestselling Jack Ryan series.
 
For decades, Taiwan has been a thorn in the side of the Chinese government. An independent nation to the rest of the world, it is considered a rogue province by the PRC. Previous governments have tried to conquer the island using economic force and diplomatic pressure, but new Chinese President Li Jian Jun is done fooling around. He’s devised a secret military operation to take the island. Only one man knows how to stop Li’s mad and bloody plan for reunification and that’s Minister of Defense Qin Haiyu. Fearing for his life and the safety of his family, Qin covertly makes contact with the CIA in Beijing and signals his desire to defect to the West.
 
To get Qin out, John Clark creates an international task force reminiscent of Rainbow Six and goes undercover in mainland China. Meanwhile, Lt. Commander Katie Ryan is deployed to the tip of the spear on the destroyer USS Jason Dunham to defend Taiwan. Threatened by an encircling Chinese armada, she’s under pressure to find a flaw in the invaders’ plan for her father to exploit.
 
For his part, President Jack Ryan may have the power of the entire US military at his disposal, but what he really needs are Li’s secret plans from Defense Minister Qin so he can stave off a war. Because America’s Defense Protocol could lead to a game of mutual destruction that could cost the lives of thousands of young soldiers, sailors, special operators as well as his daughter.

## Notes - No Spoilers
* I, uh, I don't know what to say. I made some jokes about Book 24 and the new authors and how openly they cribbed _Red October_. And they acknowledged it in the book too! But this feels excessive. This is not quite "rogue Russian sub" territory, but again we have a staredown between two vessels (ships in this case) and a Ryan onboard the American one trying to deter WWIII.
* I guess we have just abandoned Jack Ryan Jr and the Campus to his own book series? And Katie is the protagonist now?
* I still like it. It's still fun. It's still exactly what I want to read at the end of the day before I fall asleep. But this just feels lazy. I know these new authors are Navy guys. I know they have a solid track record with their own novels. I suppose I just don't know what to expect.
