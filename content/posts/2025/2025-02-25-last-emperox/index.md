> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?
After a couple of years of effort, I finally caught up to the current state of Jack Ryan novels. I had previously read Scalzi books that I enjoyed quite a bit, so I decided to check out the rest of his catalog in the interest of picking more SciFi back up.

Like the Ryan novels, the real goal here is to have something fun to read for 20 minutes before I fall asleep. And this met that goal.

I finished the first and second books in this series and my pace really picked up. I started the third book here as soon as I finished the second. Two days later and I was done with the trilogy.

### Publisher Summary

The Last Emperox is the thrilling conclusion to the award-winning, New York Times and USA Today bestselling Interdependency series, an epic space opera adventure from Hugo Award-winning author John Scalzi.

The collapse of The Flow, the interstellar pathway between the planets of the Interdependency, has accelerated. Entire star systems‚Äïand billions of people‚Äïare becoming cut off from the rest of human civilization. This collapse was foretold through scientific prediction . . . and yet, even as the evidence is obvious and insurmountable, many still try to rationalize, delay and profit from, these final days of one of the greatest empires humanity has ever known.

Emperox Grayland II has finally wrested control of her empire from those who oppose her and who deny the reality of this collapse. But ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù is a slippery thing, and even as Grayland strives to save as many of her people form impoverished isolation, the forces opposing her rule will make a final, desperate push to topple her from her throne and power, by any means necessary. Grayland and her thinning list of allies must use every tool at their disposal to save themselves, and all of humanity. And yet it may not be enough.

Will Grayland become the savior of her civilization . . . or the last emperox to wear the crown?

## Notes - No Spoilers
* I had a blast the whole time. Really a great, tight, trilogy.
* Obvious that Kiva became his favorite character as the series continued.
* We probably spent too much time with Nadashe and the rest of the Wu family. I would have rather spent more of that time exploring the different plans and preperations for the Flow collapse. To be fair, Scalzi did devote a section to this.
* This was published five years ago. No sign of new entries to the series despite perfect set ups for them.
* Chenevert was my favorite Book 2 addition and someone I would have always been excited to spend more time with.
