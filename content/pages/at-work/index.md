I work on the Emerging Technology and Incubation team at Cloudflare. We ship the future that we think our customers will need months and years from now. I help solve a fun range of problems as  VP, Strategic Advisor & Chief of Staff.

That title is a mouthful. It mostly just means that I have a license to ship. I spend my time finding oddly shaped problems and building technology to solve them.

I previously spent six years launching, building, and leading the [Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/) [product line](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one-one-year-later/) at Cloudflare as the VP of Product.

I [shipped](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-access-now-teams-of-any-size-can-turn-off-their-vpn/) the first prototype in that group into GA as a Product Manager in 2018. A few years later we became the [only new vendor in the Gartner Magic Quadrant](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-sse-gartner-magic-quadrant/) and then made the biggest leap the [year following](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-sse-gartner-magic-quadrant-2024). From the [US Federal Government](https://blog.cloudflare.com/helping-keep-governments-safe-and-secure/) to [Fortune 500 companies](https://cloudflare.tv/shows/connect/keynote-how-roche-is-adopting-zero-trust-principles/0ZbDrlvM) to start-ups on our [free plan](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/zero-trust-services/), tens of thousands of teams trust us to keep their organizations safe.

In June of 2024 I decided to hand the keys to Cloudflare One to the team I had assembled. They could do it better than me and I could find new problems. The Cloudflare SASE business is now run by the brilliant product leaders that joined me on that journey. Meanwhile, I've been sent back to the lab to help figure out what's next.

> Also, [I killed Railgun](https://blog.cloudflare.com/deprecating-railgun). It was me. I'm sorry.

## 2018 - Product Manager of Access and Registrar

I joined Cloudflare as a Product Manager in our Research & Development wing, what we now call Emerging Technology and Incubation. I [launched](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-access-now-teams-of-any-size-can-turn-off-their-vpn/) Cloudflare Access to help teams turn off their legacy VPN. Even more fun, I [launched](https://blog.cloudflare.com/using-cloudflare-registrar/) Cloudflare Registrar to provide at-cost domain registration to anyone on Earth.

## 2019 - Product Manager of Access, Registrar, and Tunnel

Customers liked Access, but they wanted more. We added workflows that sat outside of a traditional browser by introducing support for [SSH](https://blog.cloudflare.com/releasing-the-cloudflare-access-feature-that-let-us-smash-a-vpn-on-stage), [service tokens](https://blog.cloudflare.com/give-your-automated-services-credentials-with-access-service-tokens), [command line flows](https://blog.cloudflare.com/leave-your-vpn-and-curl-secure-apis-with-cloudflare-access), and [RDP](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-access-now-supports-rdp).

I also became the Product Manager of [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/), our private networking toolkit. [We made it free](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-free-argo-tunnel-for-your-next-project) to give more organizations secure ways to connect.

Meanwhile, we realized that DNSSEC is hard but we could make it seamless. We shipped [one-click DNSSEC](https://blog.cloudflare.com/one-click-dnssec-with-cloudflare-registrar) to all Registrar customers at no cost. I handed off Registrar to a fantastic Product Manager that we added to the team so that I could focus on what was evolving into the Zero Trust portfolio.

## 2020 - Director of Product for Cloudflare Zero Trust

COVID accelerated the timeline for many of our customers to migrate away from their legacy security and networking models. I ran a [free program](https://blog.cloudflare.com/zero-trust-week-setting-up-cloudflare-one-as-a-small-business) for teams to onboard. Dozens of employees from all departments signed up to guide organizations.

We shipped faster. Teams could bring [multiple identity providers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/multi-sso-and-cloudflare-access-adding-linkedin-and-github-teams/), [control](https://blog.cloudflare.com/releasing-cloudflare-access-most-requested-feature/) providers by application, require [hard keys](https://blog.cloudflare.com/require-hard-key-auth-with-cloudflare-access/), [manage the regions](https://blog.cloudflare.com/two-clicks-to-enable-regional-zero-trust-compliance/) in use, deploy [long-lived](https://blog.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnels-that-live-forever/) private networks, and send users to an [app launcher](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-the-cloudflare-access-app-launch/).

We extended Zero Trust [control to SaaS apps](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-access-for-saas/), too, and I was part of the team that was [awarded the patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11394710?trk=public_profile_patent-button) for this work. At this point the Zero Trust business had grown from just an access control product to a portfolio and we [retooled our dashboard to reflect that](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-single-dashboard-for-cloudflare-for-teams/).

I also ran out of time in 2020. Thankfully I had the privilege of hiring a team of Product Managers.

## 2021 - Director of Product for Cloudflare Zero Trust

The problems our customers had in this space began to evolve and so did we. We [launched](https://blog.cloudflare.com/data-loss-prevention/) a comprehensive Data Loss Prevention (DLP) suite. The Secure Web Gateway (SWG) became more [mature](https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/gateway) while the Access and Tunnel products began to [replace entire corporate networks](https://blog.cloudflare.com/build-your-own-private-network-on-cloudflare/).

Customers responded. CISA, the US Government's national cybersecurity risk advisor, [selected Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://blog.cloudflare.com/helping-keep-governments-safe-and-secure) to offer Internet security to all civilian agencies.

## 2022 - VP of Product for Cloudflare Zero Trust

As much as we love to build at Cloudflare, sometimes we need to bring in experts from outside the firm. One challenge that our customers kept running into was the security of data-at-rest and posture controls in their SaaS applications. We jumped ahead to solve this problem by [acquiring Vectrix](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-zero-trust-casb).

## 2023 - VP of Product for Cloudflare Zero Trust

The team only shipped faster. We became the [only new vendor in the Gartner Magic Quadrant](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-sse-gartner-magic-quadrant/).

## 2024 - VP, Strategic Advisor & CoS - Emerging Technology and Incubation

### Returning to ETI

More enterprises adopted Cloudflare Zero Trust - and they loved it - Gartner named us a [Customers' Choice](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/zero-trust-network-access/vendor/cloudflare/product/cloudflare-access) vendor based on that feedback and we kept moving up the [Magic Quadrant](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-sse-gartner-magic-quadrant-2024).

I also realized "hey, I think my team can do this - and do this really well - without me." The team I had assembled could thrive on their own and it probably made more sense to tackle new problems at Cloudflare. I volunteered to handover leadership of Cloudflare Zero Trust to my direct reports and I jumped back into our Emerging Technology and Incubation division in June.

### AI Content Controls

Most recently, I [launched](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-ai-audit-control-ai-content-crawlers/) our new AI Audit tool to help publishers of great content control and find value from the publication of that content in a world of AI bots.
