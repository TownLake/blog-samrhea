> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?

I have been burning through the Scalzi bibliography and this is his newest publication.

### Publisher Summary

New York Times bestselling author John Scalzi flies you to the moon with his most fantastic tale to date: When the Moon Hits Your EyeThe moon has turned into cheese.Now humanity has to deal with it.For some itâ€™s an opportunity. For others itâ€™s a moment to question their faith: In God, in science, in everything. Still others try to keep the world running in the face of absurdity and uncertainty. And then there are the billions looking to the sky and wondering how a thing that was always just there is now... something absolutely impossible.

Astronauts and billionaires, comedians and bank executives, professors and presidents, teenagers and terminal patients at the end of their lives -- over the length of an entire lunar cycle, each get their moment in the moonlight. To panic, to plan, to wonder and to pray, to laugh and to grieve. All in a kaleidoscopic novel that goes all the places youâ€™d expect, and then to so many places you wouldnâ€™t.Itâ€™s a wild moonage daydream. Ride this rocket.

## Notes - No Spoilers

* It took me a while to get into it. The short slice-of-life vignettes wore on me until they didn't. By the end, especially the more "world is ending" stories, I was very intrigued.
* I appreciate the Andy Weir shout out.
* I like the author's trajectory. Especially "I was writing for other people, not me and that wasn't working."
