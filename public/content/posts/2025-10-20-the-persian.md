> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?

I [finished and liked](https://blog.samrhea.com/post/2025-09-15-moscow-x) _Moscow X_, and then I [finished and liked](https://blog.samrhea.com/post/2025-10-15-damascus-station) _Damascus Station_, so I figured it was time to follow my usual routine and read everything the author has ever published.

### Publisher Summary

Kamran Esfahani, a dentist living out a dreary existence in Stockholm, agrees to spy for the Mossad after he‚Äôs recruited by Arik Glitzman, the chief of a clandestine unit tasked with running targeted assassinations and sabotage inside Iran. At Glitzman‚Äôs direction, Kam returns to his native Tehran and opens a dental practice there, using it as a cover for the Israeli intelligence agency. Kam proves to be a skillful asset, quietly earning money helping Glitzman smuggle weapons, run surveillance, and conduct kidnappings. But when Kam tries to recruit an Iranian widow seeking to avenge the death of her husband at the hands of the Mossad, the operation goes terribly wrong, landing him in prison under the watchful eye of a sadistic officer whom he knows only as the ‚ÄúGeneral.‚Äù

And now, after enduring three years of torture in captivity, Kamran Esfahani sits in an interrogation room across from the General, preparing to write his final confession.

Kam knows it is too late to save himself. But he has managed to keep one secret‚Äïonly one‚Äïand he just might be able to save that. In this haunting thriller, careening between Tehran and Tel Aviv, Istanbul and Stockholm, David McCloskey delivers an intricate story of vengeance, deceit, and the power of love and forgiveness in a world of lies.

## Notes ‚Äì No Spoilers

* We were close! So close! And in the last five pages he walked away from being true to Le Carr√©'s inspiration.
* Or was it all a dream?
* Really enjoyed this one. Significant departure in style and tone and format from his other books, but same genre and thoroughness of research.
