> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?

James SA Corey is the author (team) behind _The Expanse_ and a newer series, _The Captive's War_. I read the first book in _The Captive's War_, _The Mercy of Gods_, a few months ago and picked up this side novella just to make sure I was not missing anything in the canon.

I debated including this in my list because it is, technically, a "novella."

## Notes - No Spoilers

* Whew, fast but tough read. Fun short story.
* Not sure if it makes the first full novel in the series make more or less sense, but I'm intrigued.
