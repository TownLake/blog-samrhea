> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?

Amazon has me profiled and it is pretty sure I am an American dad in his mid-to-late 30s. The books they surface to me are no surprise these days given my reading history with Tom Clancy and more recently Elliot Ackerman.

I was on the hunt for something new after reading Ackerman's latest, _Sheepdogs_, and I found David McCloskey's novels. I figured I'd enjoy them (I was right) and picked up the one that felt closest to home given that I was in Northern Europe when I bought it.

### Publisher Summary

CIA officers Sia and Max enter Russia under commercial cover to recruit Vladimir Putinâ€™s moneyman. Sia works for a London law firm that conceals the wealth of the superrich. Maxâ€™s family business in Mexicoâ€”a CIA front since the 1960sâ€”is a farm that breeds high-end racehorses. They pose as a couple to target Vadim, Putinâ€™s private banker, and his wife, Anna, whoâ€”unbeknownst to CIAâ€”is a Russian intelligence officer under deep cover at the bank. As they descend further into a Russian world dripping with luxury and rife with gangland violence, Sia and Maxâ€™s only hope may be Anna, who is playing a game of her own. Careening between the horse ranch in northern Mexico, the corridors of Langley, and the dark opulence of Putinâ€™s Russia, Moscow X is both a gripping thriller of modern espionage and a raw, unsparing commentary on the nature of truth, loyalty, and vengeance amid the shadow war between the United States and Russia.

## Notes - No Spoilers

* I enjoyed it! I'm going to read his prior book next.
* I appreciated a few Texas shout outs.
* I need to read more about Russia.
* I get the Le CarrÃ© references, at least in broad sweeping terms. Lot of spy intrigue. No fancy speedboats or exploding wrist watches. I do think that misses much of what made Le CarrÃ© special, though. None of his protagonists were super handsome, ultra wealthy cowboys. No one lived happily ever after. The bad guys won often.
