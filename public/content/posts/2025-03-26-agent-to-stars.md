> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?

I have really enjoyed reading Scalzi novels over the last year. I finished _Redshirts_ most recently, after the Interdependency trilogy, and I decided to go through more of the back catalog.

## Notes - No Spoilers

* You can see how much he invests into his characters. As well as some Scalzi character tropes (somewhat clueless but well-meaning and nerdy male protagonist, strong female lead partnering up with him).
* I really, really liked how the aliens were written. Their whole attitude. Their whole vibe. I would be so happy to hang out with them.
