> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?

I bought this book years ago. I don't remember what prompted the purchase. I'm sure some kind of review at the time. This book won the Hugo Award when it was published, after all. I just never picked it up until I started reading Scalzi's other books after picking SciFi novels back up as my Tom Clancy run caught up to the present.

### Publisher Summary

Ensign Andrew Dahl has just been assigned to the Universal Union Capital Ship Intrepid, flagship of the Universal Union since the year 2456. Itâ€™s a prestige posting, with the chance to serve on "Away Missions" alongside the starshipâ€™s famous senior officers.

Life couldnâ€™t be betterâ€¦until Andrew begins to realize that (1) every Away Mission involves a lethal confrontation with alien forces, (2) the shipâ€™s senior officers always survive these confrontations, and (3) sadly, at least one low-ranking crew member is invariably killed. Unsurprisingly, the savvier crew members belowdecks avoid Away Missions at all costs. Then Andrew stumbles on information that transforms his and his colleaguesâ€™ understanding of what the starship Intrepid really isâ€¦and offers them a crazy, high-risk chance to save their own lives.

## Notes - No Spoilers
* I really enjoyed it! Not as much as I liked the Interdependency trilogy, but this is just a different kind of novel. Humorous, meta, playful. And just a fun thought experiment.
* Lot of clever turns, like the Dahl-as-protagonist jab at the end there.
* I loved the reference to one of my favorite movies, Stranger Than Fiction, something | have long thought was criminally under-appreciated.
* The codas dragged on.
* Probably the first book I've read entirely through the Kindle app on my iPhone.
