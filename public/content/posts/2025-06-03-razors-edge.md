> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?

I have spent most of 2025 in a SciFi era and have enjoyed reading books by the writing team James S.A. Corey, especially their newest series _The Mercy of the Gods_. I was digging through their back catalog while waiting on the next novel and noticed they wrote a Star Wars story years ago. And it was the second of a two-novel series with the first written by Martha Wells, another Hugo Award winner.

While these are no longer canon (following the great Disney Legends purge) I still love Star Wars and I love James S.A. Corey so I figured I'd pick this up. Bonus points that the first novel in the series was written by Wells. It felt like the OKC Thunder in 2011 - a team of people early in their careers really going places.

### Publisher Summary

Times are desperate for the Rebel Alliance. Harassment by the Empire and a shortage of vital supplies are hindering completion of a new secret base on the ice planet Hoth. So when Mid Rim merchants offer much-needed materials for sale, Princess Leia Organa and Han Solo lead an Alliance delegation to negotiate a deal.

But when treachery forces the rebel ship to flee into territory controlled by pirates, Leia makes a shocking discovery: the fierce marauders come from Leia’s homeworld of Alderaan, recently destroyed by the Death Star. These refugees have turned to pillaging and plundering to survive—and they are in debt to a pirate armada, which will gladly ransom the princess to the vengeful Empire . . . if they find out her true identity.

Struggling with intense feelings of guilt, loyalty, and betrayal, Leia is determined to help her wayward kinspeople, even as Imperial forces are closing in on her own crippled ship. Trapped between lethal cutthroats and brutal oppressors, Leia and Han, along with Luke, Chewbacca, and a battle-ready crew, must defy death—or embrace it—to keep the rebellion alive.

## Notes - No Spoilers

* I get that Star Wars is really the story of a few personalities and is campier than we think (at least it used to be). But, man, we spent a whole lot of time on that pirate asteroid. Just like a slog of time. The only person more ready to leave than the heroes was me.
* Always fun to see Han and Chewie's relationship play out.
* Optimistic about Book 2.
