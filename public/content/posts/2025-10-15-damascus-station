> ## Not a Book Report  
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?

I finished and liked *Moscow X* so I figured it was time to follow my usual routine and read everything the author has ever published.

### Publisher Summary

CIA case officer Sam Joseph is dispatched to Paris to recruit Syrian Palace official Mariam Haddad. The two fall into a forbidden relationship, which supercharges Haddad's recruitment and creates unspeakable danger when they enter Damascus to find the man responsible for the disappearance of an American spy.

But the cat and mouse chase for the killer soon leads to a trail of high-profile assassinations and the discovery of a dark secret at the heart of the Syrian regime, bringing the pair under the all-seeing eyes of Assad's spy catcher, Ali Hassan, and his brother Rustum, the head of the feared Republican Guard. Set against the backdrop of a Syria pulsing with fear and rebellion, Damascus Station is a gripping thriller that offers a textured portrayal of espionage, love, loyalty, and betrayal in one of the most difficult CIA assignments on the planet.

## Notes — No Spoilers

* Yeah, the Le Carre comparisons continue to be appropriate. Maybe less depressing but definitely no truly happy endings.
* Interesting to read this now knowing how the Civil War concluded.
* Surely someone has the movie rights already here.
* Alright, I'm liking Proctor more and more now.
