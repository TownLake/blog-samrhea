## Teaching

I will be teaching `Intro to Product Management` at [NOVA SBE](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/) this fall. Are you a student interested in the class? Please reach out!

## Studying

I studied in the [Plan II Program](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/plan2/) at The University of Texas at Austin. Yes, it is a major in and of itself.

My diploma doesn't matter at all, though. Where we went to school _maybe_ impacts our first job. I bring it up here because **I loved Plan II**. The admittedly weird curriculum seems well-equipped to prepare students for whatever oddball form the future will take. I served on the Board of Visitors before I moved to Portugal and I continue to believe that Plan II is a model worth replicating.

You know what else doesn't really matter? Your grades. I had a perfect GPA in all coursework across every subject and department they sent Plan II students to attend - and the only time that achievement impacts my life is when I wake up in a cold sweat thinking I bombed a test and lost my precious `4.0`, something that amuses my wife endlessly. Your grades only count if they become something your spouse enjoys teasing you about.
