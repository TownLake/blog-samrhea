      "description": "A server transmits to a third-party application a request for a resource that is received from a client. The server receives an authentication request from the client device that has been generated by the third-party application. The server transmits an identity provider selection page to the client device that allows the client device to select an identity provider. The server causes the client device to transmit a second authentication request to a selected identity provider. The server receives an authentication response that was generated by the identity provider that includes the identity of the user. The server enforces access rule(s) including identity-based rule(s) and/or non-identity based rule(s). If the user is permitted to access the third-party application, the server causes an authentication response to be transmitted from the client device to the third-party application that indicates the user has successfully authenticated."
