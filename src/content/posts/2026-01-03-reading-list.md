You [keep a log](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading/) of the books you read as part of this blog. Like the previous years, Claude is going to handle the analysis for you. You have a large block of semi-structured data. You want some analysis. And that analysis is better done externally since you are biased.

## Observations & Highlights

### 1. The Year of Scalzi
You read **8 John Scalzi novels** this year — a full third of your reading list. After catching up on the Jack Ryan universe, you discovered Scalzi's catalog and burned through the Interdependency trilogy, Redshirts, Starter Villain, Kaiju Preservation Society, Agent to the Stars, and his newest release. His witty, accessible sci-fi became your go-to bedtime reading.

### 2. Spy Novel Renaissance
David McCloskey became your new favorite discovery. You read all four of his novels back-to-back after Amazon correctly profiled you as "an American dad in his mid-to-late 30s." The Le Carré comparisons are apt — these are serious spy novels without exploding wrist watches.

### 3. The Bobiverse Binge
You closed out the year by discovering Dennis E. Taylor's Bobiverse trilogy and tore through all three books in under two weeks. The combination of sci-fi, humor, and Factorio-style logistics problems hit exactly right.

### 4. One Paperback Wonder
*Sell Us the Rope* was your only physical book of the year, purchased at an adorable bookstore in Friday Harbor during a friend's wedding. Sometimes you need to remember how much you love browsing English-language bookstores.

### 5. Jack Ryan Catches Up
After years of working through the Tom Clancy extended universe, you finally caught up. Only 2 Jack Ryan novels this year (both by the new author duo), and they're starting to recycle Red October plots a bit too openly.

### 6. Reading on Your Phone
You read the entirety of *Redshirts* on the Kindle app on your iPhone. A first for you. Desperate times in a Tel Aviv hotel room, apparently.

### 7. The Summer Lull
*Honor Among Thieves* took you nearly three months to finish (June through August) — your longest reading drought in years. A very busy toddler, work travel, and a Star Wars novel that dragged on a pirate asteroid all contributed.

### 8. Travel Reading
Your reading locations expanded significantly: Bangalore, Abu Dhabi, Tel Aviv, Friday Harbor, Amsterdam, Munich, Manchester. The Kindle continues to be the best travel companion.

## Final Thoughts

You read **60% more books** in 2025 than in the previous two years. The big driver? Finding authors you love and reading their entire catalogs. Scalzi led the way with 8 books, McCloskey added 4, and Taylor closed the year with 3.

The trade-off was almost entirely abandoning non-fiction. Only one non-fiction book this year versus seven last year. The pendulum will probably swing back — you mentioned in a few posts that you need to read more history again.

Your reading remained almost entirely digital (23 of 24 books). Lisbon and Sintra remained home base, but the Kindle traveled well to new destinations.

Looking at the trajectory: 2023 was the year you rediscovered reading. 2024 was catching up on Clancy and adding some sci-fi. 2025 was going all-in on sci-fi and spy novels. What's next? Maybe some non-fiction. Maybe catching up on the Bobiverse sequels. Maybe something entirely new.

Whatever it is, you'll keep logging it here.
