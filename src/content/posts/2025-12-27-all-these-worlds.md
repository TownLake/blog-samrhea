> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?
I finished the second book in the series and immediately started the third book.

### Publisher Summary

The Bobs are on a mission to save the world – and a few worlds more. The Deltan civilization on the planet Deltans home world is dying. Its sun is about to go red giant, and the Deltans have neither the resources nor the technology to relocate. Without help, they will be destroyed.

Milo – a new-generation Bob – is tasked with making a deal with the Deltans. But negotiations are complicated by hostile aliens, a suspicious government, and the sheer magnitude of the project. It's one thing to save a village, or even a country, but trying to save an entire species? That's a whole different level.
