> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?
I finished the first book in the series and immediately ordered the next book.

### Publisher Summary

Bob Johansson didn't believe in an afterlife, so waking up after being killed in a car accident was a shock. To add to the surprise, he is now a sentient computer and the controlling intelligence for a Von Neumann probe. Bob and his copies have been spreading out from Earth for 40 years now, looking for habitable planets. But that's the only good news. Wherever they go, they find evidence of intelligent life – and destruction. The universe seems to be a very dangerous place.

Back on Earth, the Brazilian space force is up to something. And the Chinese space force is getting ready to do something about it. And neither country is happy about the existence of Bob. What could possibly go wrong?

## Notes - No Spoilers
* Had a blast! Again!
* Enjoyed the introduction of The Others, the use of the colonists to give us more non-Bob characters.
* Really really need a map of the Bobs combined with a family tree.
