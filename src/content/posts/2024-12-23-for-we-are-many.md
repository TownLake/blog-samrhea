> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?
I finished the first book in the series and immediately dove into this one. I couldn't wait to see what happened next with all the Bobs scattered across the galaxy.

### Publisher Summary

Bob Johansson didn't believe in an afterlife, so waking up after being killed in a car accident was a shock. To add to the surprise, he is now a sentient computer and the controlling intelligence for a Von Neumann probe. Bob and his copies have been spreading out from Earth for 40 years now, looking for habitable planets. But that's the only good news. Wherever they go, they find evidence of intelligent life – and destruction. The universe seems to be a very dangerous place.

Back on Earth, the Brazilian space force is up to something. And the Chinese space force is getting ready to do something about it. And neither country is happy about the existence of Bob. What could possibly go wrong?

## Notes - No Spoilers
* Even better than the first! The expanding cast of Bobs with their distinct personalities is fantastic.
* Love how each Bob develops their own interests and projects across different star systems.
* The stakes feel higher with multiple civilizations facing extinction events.
* The Earth politics subplot adds good tension, though the space adventures are the real draw.
* The humor remains sharp - the Bobs' banter and pop culture references never get old.
* Can't wait to start the third book!
