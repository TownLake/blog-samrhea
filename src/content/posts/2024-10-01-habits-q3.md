## Quick Context

I am [consistent](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2020/calcheck-and-meeting-note-accountability) and [organized](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/euro-office-time) to a fault. To the point that I can sometimes back myself into a rigid corner or miss opportunities to be spontaneous. Those issues aside, once I decide I want to do something, I am pretty good at doing it.

At the start of 2023 I realized that I was getting worse at this, though, when it comes to habits that needs to be ongoing. Projects are easy. Creating consistent routines? Less so.

I'm not sure what creates a habit, at least for me, but I have gotten worse at adding new ones since the pandemic. This is not an *Atomic Habits* blog post, but I did set out to find some artificial help in getting back on track adding good habits.

I landed on the **Streaks** [app](https://streaksapp.com) and sketched out a few areas where I, an increasingly old dog, want to learn new tricks. I've started writing down the results in [this series](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/habits/) for posterity and accountability.

I measure this each quarter in a series that I publish on this blog; you can find previous editions [here](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/habits/).

## AM Habits

The goal is to do these before 7AM. This is especially true now that I am a parent. For some tasks that require deeper focus this is my only time when I can focus at all.

⏰: Don't hit the snooze button.

💪: Knock out 100 push ups each day.

👁️: Work out before breakfast. Otherwise I sit down, eat, start reading email and then the time crunch becomes a huge stress if I want to work out before I need to get into the office.

🦷: Floss my teeth.

🫧: Rinse with mouthwash.

🐦: Avoid social media before 10AM.

### Health Habits

Goals that contribute to general health and well being.

🕗: Close the kitchen at 8pm. I am an early eater - left to my own devices I eat dinner at about 6 PM. When I eat after 8 PM I am not hungry - I am scrounging because I am bored. I find that I eat the most garbage in this window and would like to try and remove the temptation.

🚰: Drink 3 L of water each day; excluding water that comes from food or other drinks like coffee.

🌄: Prepare for my morning the night before.

☀️: Apply sunscreen to my face and neck each day.

| Month | 🕗 | 🚰 | 🌄 | ☀️ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jan | 🟩 | 🥇 | ⬜ | 🥇 |
| Feb | 🟨 | 🥇 | ⬜ | 🥇 |

| Jul | 🟧 | 🥇 | 🟥 | 🥇 |
| Aug | 🟩 | 🥇 | 🟧 | 🟩 |
| Sep | 🟩 | 🥇 | 🟧 | 🟩 |

### Creativity or Learning Habits

✍️: Write for 20 minutes each day excluding writing I do for work.

🇵🇹: Spend 30 minutes each day practicing Portuguese.

## Why do this?

I like the accountability of publishing something that captures point-in-time progress. I also enjoy [sharing](https://blog.samrhea.com/pages/projects#%EF%B8%8F-productivity) how I think about work.

Like everything in this blog, though, I do this for me. I am both sentimental and filled with existential dread. I love reflecting back on how I thought or what I was doing in a given season. I find joy in writing something that has [somewhat public](https://blog.samrhea.com/pages/projects#%EF%B8%8F-this-blog) permanence. If anything, I'm [feeding the models](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2022/five-minute-ai-site).

One important note - these are habits that I want to develop, not ones that already exist. I'm pretty good at brushing my teeth and never skip a work out etc. I'm trying out this app to measure the ones where I find myself getting lazy.

## What did I learn this round?

* Nothing is less conducive to learning a foreign language than having a child (and returning to work on top of that).
* Travel, again, kills these. Travel picked back up as work has ramped back up following my parental leave. That just destroys habits. I guess for a good cause.
* I have my regular dentist appointment this week and, man, I'm at least excited for that. I am only good at dental hygiene habits apparently.
