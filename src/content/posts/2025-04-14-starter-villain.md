> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?

I continue to go through the Scalzi catalog. This is another book of his that sits outside of the SciFi genre that first drew me to his work.

### Publisher Summary

Now a New York Times bestseller!Inheriting your uncle's supervillain business is more complicated than you might think. Particularly when you discover who's running the place.Charlie's life is going nowhere fast. A divorced substitute teacher living with his cat in a house his siblings want to sell, all he wants is to open a pub downtown, if only the bank will approve his loan.Then his long-lost uncle Jake dies and leaves his supervillain business (complete with island volcano lair) to Charlie.

But becoming a supervillain isn't all giant laser death rays and lava pits. Jake had enemies, and now they're coming after Charlie. His uncle might have been a stand-up, old-fashioned kind of villain, but these are the real thing: rich, soulless predators backed by multinational corporations and venture capital. It's up to Charlie to win the war his uncle started against a league of supervillains. But with unionized dolphins, hyper-intelligent talking spy cats, and a terrifying henchperson at his side, going bad is starting to look pretty good.In a dog-eat-dog world...be a cat.

## Notes - No Spoilers

* I loved it. I loved the whole thing.
* I wish I had read it before I read _When the Moon Hits Your Eye_ because I think I would have understood his tone and voice better.
* I appreciate the quip about a great mission statement vs saying what you actually do.
* The dolphins protesting, especially repeating certain insults in unison, made me laugh out loud on a flight.
* "Cats are fucking class traitors"
