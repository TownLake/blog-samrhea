> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?

I was in Friday Harbor, a small town on an Island about an hour away from Seattle by seaplane for a friend's wedding. The place is picturesque. Just something out of a Hallmark movie. And of course their little main street has an adorable bookstore.

So we went. And I forgot how much I loved being in an English-language bookstore. The smell, the atmosphere, the selection. And I started browsing and figured I'd enjoy walking away with a paperback to read while I was on the island. I was right.

So I found something that felt like the right size (200-300 pages), a topic I find interesting (European revolutions), and something that felt "fun" enough for a vacation read.

### Publisher Summary

In London in 1907, a decade before the revolution, young Stalin has yet to achieve the power, nor acted on the ruthlessness, that will define his legacy. Instead Koba, as he is known, arrives in London for the 5th Congress of the Russian Communist Part where he-and many of his fellow Bolsheviks-are only allowed to remain as a nonvoting witness. But his inability to vote does not limit his ability to act, and Stalin quickly begins forging alliances with the likes of Lenin, Trotsky, Rosa Luxemburg-and a vivacious Finnish activist named Elli Vuokko.

As the Congress progresses, Koba begins to take daring risks-with the young Finnish idealist, with his past relationships to the Russian government, and with his future in the party. But as he manipulates those loyal to him and seeks to discover who he will remain loyal to in return, we see a great political mind in the works, and witness the development of a dictator.

## Notes - No Spoilers

* Goods as advertised! This was fast-paced and interesting.
* Some of it was a bit heavy handed, but it is historical fiction so of course.
* It's been a while since I veered out of SciFi or Action novels (again, most of what I've read the last couple of years has been the stuff you pick up before bed). I need to do it more.
